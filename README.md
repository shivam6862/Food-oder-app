## Description

A food order app frontend in React is a user interface that allows customers to order food items from a menu displayed on the app. Users can browse through different food options, add items to their cart, and place an order for delivery or pickup. The app may also display information about the restaurant, including location, hours of operation, and reviews. The frontend in React provides a responsive and intuitive interface for users to interact with the app on different devices.</br>

This information can help customers feel more connected to the restaurant and may encourage them to order food from the app.</br>
